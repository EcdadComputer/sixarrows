<h2 data-i18n="index-h2-whatis">What is SixArrows?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-p-answer">Sixarrows is a Kemalist quiz inspired by and cloned upon the <a href="https://leftvalues.github.io/">LeftValues</a> quiz that seeks to identify your position within the 6 Pillars of Kemalism. If you are not a Kemalist, or don't like Kemalists, this quiz is obviously not suited for you. You will be presented with a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. The questions for each axes are presented in order, rather than scattered. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2 data-i18n="index-h2-whatvalues">What are the values?</h2>
  <p data-i18n="index-sixaxes">There are currently six axes, each of which has two opposing values. They are:</p>
  <p data-i18n="index-rev-desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#BC4040;">Republicanism</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#602600;">Authoritarianism</b><br/>
     Republicanism (Turkish: cumhuriyetçilik) in the Kemalist framework replaced the absolute monarchy of the Ottoman dynasty with the rule of law, popular sovereignty and civic virtue, including an emphasis on liberty practiced by citizens. Kemalist republicanism defines a type of constitutional republic, in which representatives of the people are elected, and must govern in accordance with existing constitutional law limiting governmental power over citizens. The head of state and other officials are chosen by election rather than inheriting their positions, and their decisions are subject to judicial review. In defending the change from the Ottoman State, Kemalism asserts that all laws of the Republic of Turkey should be inspired by actual needs here on Earth as a basic tenet of national life. Kemalism advocates a republican system as the best representative of the wishes of the people..</p>
	<p data-i18n="index-sci-desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#B21018;">Populist</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#444444;">Anti-Populist</b><br/>
      Populism (Turkish: halkçılık) is defined as a social revolution aimed to transfer the political power to citizenship. Kemalist populism not only to establish popular sovereignty but also the transfer of the social-economic transformation to realize a true populist state. However, Kemalist reject class conflict and believe national unity is above all else. To Kemalist populism envision a sociality that emphasizes work and national unity. Populism in Turkey is to create a unifying force that brings a sense of the Turkish state and the power of the people to bring in that new unity..</p>
	<p data-i18n="index-cent-desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#560000;">Etatism (Statism)</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#917600;">Laissez-Faire</b><br/>
        Statism (Turkish: devletçilik): Kemal Atatürk made clear in his statements and policies that Turkey's complete modernization was very much dependent on economic and technological development. The principle of Kemalist Statism is generally interpreted to mean that the state was to regulate the country's general economic activities and engage in areas where private enterprises are not willing to do so. This was the result of post-revolutionary Turkey needing to redefine the relationship between societal and international capitalism. The revolution left Turkey in ruins as the Ottoman empire was focused on raw materials and was an open market in the international capitalist system. Post-revolutionary Turkey is largely defined by its agricultural society which includes many landlords and merchant. The control of people in the Turkish economy is quite evident from 1923 to 1930s but they still managed, through foreign joint investment, to establish a state economic enterprise. However, after the 1930s depression, there was a shift to more inward-looking development strategies during an era generally referred to as etatism. During this era, the state had an active involvement in both capital accumulation and investment as well as taking the interest of private businesses into consideration. The state often stepped into economic areas that the private sector did not cover, either due to not being strong enough or having failed to do so. These were often infrastructure projects and power stations but also iron and steel industries, while the masses shouldered the burden of the capital accumulation..</p>
	<p data-i18n="index-int-desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#004C7F;">Nationalist</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#87248E;">Globalist</b><br/>
        Nationalism (Turkish: milliyetçilik): The Kemalist revolution aimed to create a nation state from the remnants of the multi-religious and multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire. Kemalist nationalism originates from the social contract theories, especially from the principles advocated by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and his Social Contract. The Kemalist perception of social contract was effected by the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire which was perceived as a product of failure of the Ottoman "Millet" system and the ineffective Ottomanism. Kemalist nationalism, after experiencing the Ottoman Empire's breakdown into pieces, defined the social contract as its "highest ideal"..</p>
	<p data-i18n="index-party-desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#5C3396;">Secularism(Laicite)</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#005108;">Fundamentalism</b><br/>
        The laicism (Turkish: laiklik) of Kemalist ideology aims to banish religious interference in government affairs, and vice versa. It differs from the passive Anglo-American concept of secularism, but is similar to the concept of laïcité in France..</p>
	<p data-i18n="index-cons-desc" class="value-description"><b style="color:#C45617;">Progressive</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#37712E;">Conservative</b><br/>
        Reformism or "Revolutionism" (Turkish: inkılâpçılık) is a principle which calls for the country to replace the traditional institutions and concepts with modern institutions and concepts. This principle advocated the need for fundamental social change through revolution as a strategy to achieve a modern society. The core of the revolution, in the Kemalist sense, was an accomplished fact. In a Kemalist sense there is no possibility of return to the old systems because they were deemed backward..</p>
<h2 data-i18n="index-h2-closest">What does "Closest Match" mean in the results?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-p-similar">It doesn't mean anything actually. These questions and sects are not well-made, and also this site is not made for serious uses, please don't take the results seriously. Anarcho-Kemalism, what?</p>
<h2 data-i18n="index-h2-scores">I don't like my scores!</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-p-scores">We neither. You can start a debate over <a href="https://github.com/EcdadComputer/sixarrows.github.io">GitHub Page</a>.</p>
<h2 data-i18n="index-h2-tracked">Am I being tracked?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="index-p-tracked">This site is for satirical purposes only, we don't want to question anybody's opinion, or trying to abolish the integrity of the Turkish Republic, please don't take us seriously.</a>.</p>
